The city founded by the brass dragon. It resides in a canyon in the desert. It starts at the bottom of the canyon, where the first shelters and water sources originate. The regional effect of the brass dragon’s lair help indicate the entrances to these spots. Far enough into this particular ravine is the main entrance to the brass dragon’s lair, where the regional effects produce illusory images of monsters. The Ravillans love to see the horrified reactions of visitors who don’t know better when it comes to these illusions. The majority of the city is actually built along the walls of the ravine. Comprised of cave networks initially carved by the brass dragon and later worked by the people, and many wooden platforms, homes, and ladders (the wood being gained from trading with other dragon cities). The city acts as the only safe haven within the desert region, as the rest is either lawless wasteland, or the stormy area of the blue dragon. This results in Raville being a common spot for anyone who needs to travel through the desert at some point. The water originated from an oasis hidden within the cave of the ravine, which is where the dragon made its lair and thus the city. The city also serves as the headquarters of the Brass Beagles. Their colors are shades of yellow and hints of light green.
