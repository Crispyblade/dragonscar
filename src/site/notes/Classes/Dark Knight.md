Dark Knight

Dark Knights are not very common in this world. Most work as individual mercenaries or vigilantes and are known to be capable of deeds both great and terrible. While there are some who have joined the Bronze Battalions, they are particularly rare and other Dark Knights would consider them traitors of the path. You became a dark knight due to having one as a mentor or experienced a horrible event that awoke something dark within you. They often have a rivalry with Paladins, as people often become Paladins for very similar reasons to Dark Knights. People of all races can take this job.

Blackbloods and Abyss Knights are the most common types (though again, not very common). They can be seen rarely in the Bronze Battalions, or somewhat more often as the leader of a gang in the Black Dragonâ€™s Talons.

Dark Magus are the rarest. Only Dwarf Lalafells and Duskwight Elezen have taken this subclass these days. Due to the subterraneans having kept some knowledge of the void (believed to be the same one that Void Mages channel), their members are more capable of manipulating its essence.
