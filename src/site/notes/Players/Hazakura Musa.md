Race: Brenin [[Races/Au Ra\|Au Ra]]
Age: 24
Pronouns: She/Her
Class: [[Classes/Dark Knight\|Dark Knight]]
Background: [[Farmer\|Farmer]]
Birthplace: A subsistence farm near [[Places/Raville\|Raville]] 

At the age of 12 Haza's family farm was razed by a roving band of marauders who had gotten drunk and burned the farm down. She went on the path to get revenge against the perpetrators, especially the noble responsible.
Said band of marauders were hired by a noble who lives in [[Places/Raville\|Raville]]. 

After her farm and family were murdered, she remained an urchin in [[Places/Raville\|Raville]] fighting to survive on the streets (or an orphanage), kindling the thirst for revenge in her. While training (more like hunting) out in the wastes she came across a group of [[Places/Domhnall\|Domhnall]] soldiers beating some random guy. She quickly killed the soldiers, but the next time she was out in the wastes she walked into an ambush and was captured.
