Au Ra

The Raen Au Ra (Referred to as Brenin Au Ra in this setting) are held in high regard in any Dragon-City due to their physical traits. It is believed by most civilizations that their ancestors must have been chosen by the dragons to be their heralds. Regardless of whether this is true or false, many Au Ra have taken advantage of this belief, getting themselves into high social class positions wherever they hail from. Socialites and Nobles of other races will often attempt to get hitched to Au Ra to raise their own status.

Meanwhile the Xaela Au Ra (Referred to as the Alltud Au Ra by most people) are different tribes of Au Ra who refused to take part in the more “civilized” parts of the world, where many people value them only for their bodies and not their souls. They are very similar to how they are in the compendium, nomadic tribes who gain status and respect through actions rather than lineage.

Au Ra can be found basically everywhere, Brenin Au Ra being as common as Hyur, with Alltud Au Ra being rarer to spot due to their nomadic nature.

 Most people will treat Au Ra very well when encountering them, assuming them to be part of some higher part of society or lineage. There are those who have become very anti-Au Ra due to the imbalance between those who are and aren’t Au Ra in society
